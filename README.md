power_grid_llm is a website chatbot to help you decide when to do electrity-intensive tasks (where you have some amount of latitude on the "when" you do it) to minimize your carbon footprint.  The canonical example is doing laundry (in my house, this is by far the largest use of electricity).

Goals:
 - Educate about the grid mix (gas/solar/wind) and how it varies by day and by time and time of year
 - Do a little good (if its a cold and cloudy friday, and tomorrow is a sunny saturday, waiting till tomorrow will likely have a better power mix of solar/wind/nuclear)
 - Build some cool tech for further iteration in this space

There's a start to an MCP server for the New England Power Grid i've written at https://github.com/jasonkholden/ne_power_grid_mcp_server that should power our queries to the power grid

Coming Soon!
